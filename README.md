# Plantarama

Plantarama is a website made based on the Node.JS curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home). This website is primarily a visual focused database which also includes a small user model to autheticate and protect more destructive routes. There is also an option to "purchase" plants to depreciate stock levels.
